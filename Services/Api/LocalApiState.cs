// fields and shaping records; anything slow blocks the render loop.

// The curated Snapshot is deliberately small and hand-picked rather than
// generated. It answers the question that kept being unanswerable from a bug
// report: "what does the client believe right now, and what is holding it?" —
// in particular the gate history, which records WHO asserted a pause and WHEN.
// GET /state/full delegates to BugReportBuilder for the exhaustive version, so
// there is one collector for deep state, not two that drift.
