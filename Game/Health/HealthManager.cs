// Passive HP/MA threshold behavior. Asserts and clears
// MovementCoordinator.HealthRecoveryGate + ManaRecoveryGate on configured
// thresholds and drives the rest / stand cycle with pre- / post-rest command
// sequencing. Does NOT decide spell casts — those route through CastingDirector.
//
// State model — three transitions per pool (HP and MA each track independently):
//   Threshold breach: HP / MA drops to or below the configured rest-trigger.
//     Asserts the corresponding recovery gate. Walker (and any other gate
//     consumer) pauses immediately.
//   Rest-out: when either gate is held AND the player is out of combat
//     (PlayerState.InCombat false), send any configured pre-rest command(s) and
//     then `rest`. Idempotent — won't re-send rest while one is already in flight.
//   Recovery complete: both pools have climbed to or past their configured
//     rest-target. Clears both gates, sends `stand`, and emits any post-rest
//     command(s). Walker resumes when the last gate clears.
//
// In-combat semantics: the HP/MA gates can assert mid-fight (so the walker
// doesn't try to leave the room when a fight is going badly), but `rest` is NEVER
// sent while PlayerState.InCombat is true. As soon as CombatStateTracker clears
// the CombatGate and InCombat flips false, the next Evaluate tick fires the rest
// command.
//
// Pre/post-rest commands honour the ^M-or-; chaining convention documented on
// HealthSettings.PreRestCommand: split the string on either marker, trim each
// fragment, send each as its own wire line.
//
// Run-if-below: when PlayerState.Hp drops to or below HealthSettings.RunIfBelowHp
// OR the caster pool drops to or below HealthSettings.RunIfBelowMa mid-combat AND
// a movement engine is active, the active engine is paused and the character flees
// CombatSettings.RunDistance rooms, optionally preceded by `break`. Backward mode
// (the default) runs BFS from the current room back to the active engine's
// JourneyOrigin and walks the first RunDistance directions of that path — the
// reverse of the trail we came in on. Anchoring on the fixed origin is what keeps
// the retreat heading away from the fight instead of bouncing back into it. When
// the reverse path can't be computed (no origin / unknown room / no graph) it falls
// back to inverting the last sent direction for a single step. Forward mode ("go
// backwards if running" off) instead keeps pressing along the engine's own planned
// route toward its destination — the next RunDistance moves it would have sent
// anyway. The engine resumes via IRecoverableEngine.ResumeAfterRecovery once BOTH
// pools climb back above their run-triggers. Multi-step flee advances one queued
// direction per NoteRoomChanged.
//
// Hang-if-below: PlayerState.Hp at or below HealthSettings.HangIfBelowHp fires a
// single-shot hard disconnect via the configured exit command. Setting the
// threshold to 0 disables the check. The trigger stays live all the way through
// the bleeding-out window: a MajorMUD character at 0 HP or below hasn't died yet
// (death happens at the per-realm negative floor, BbsProfile.PlayerDiesAtHp) and
// can still hang up, so the disconnect keeps firing down to — but not past — that
// floor, giving a dropped-but-not-yet-dead character a last chance to escape.
