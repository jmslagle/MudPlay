// Combat-spell round economy — the opt-in half of CombatManager that turns the
// pure CombatSpellChooser decisions into casts on the wire. Split out of
// CombatManager.cs to keep the weapon engine and the spell sequencing each in a
// file scoped to one responsibility.
//
// Wiring is optional: until SetCombatSpellCaster runs, the engine is pure
// weapon-attack and every existing path is unchanged. Once wired,
// OnEntitiesObserved consults the chooser before the backstab / weapon path.
//
// CONFIRMED game mechanic: an announced spell attack AUTO-REPEATS server-side every
// round — it fires next tick while the target is present and mana suffices, and does
// NOT need re-announcing, exactly like a weapon swing. So this engine mirrors the
// weapon engine: it ANNOUNCES the chosen attack once (DispatchRoundAction) and the
// per-round heartbeat (OnCombatTick) re-announces ONLY when the chooser's decision
// must change (target died, MaxCasts elapsed, mana below the slot floor, immunity,
// room thinned below MinEnemies). Re-announcing a spell the server is already
// repeating was the double-cast / corpse-cast bug — hence _announcedSpellCode, the
// spell analogue of "we already sent `attack X`; the server owns the repeat."
//
// Casts route through the shared CastCoordinator.TryCast so the one-cast-per-round
// cooldown is honoured across every casting engine (a survival heal from
// CastingDirector blocks our offensive cast — survival beats offense). The INITIAL
// engage / a decision switch bypasses that round cooldown (TryCast bypassRoundCooldown)
// so a fresh mob is announced-at instantly, mirroring the weapon's cooldown-free send.

    // so the cascade's next action fires THIS round via DispatchRoundAction's instant
    // bypass-cooldown cast: the alternate attack SPELL now lands at once instead of
    // idling until the next ~5s heartbeat tick (report paradigm-20260809-162350 —
    // harm→hamm always lost a round; the weapon branch already swung immediately, only
    // the spell branch waited). DispatchRoundAction re-runs the chooser against the
    // now-immune-marked context, so it uniformly picks the alternate spell, the
    // weapon, or (both out) concedes. The per-round guard in OnSpellNoEffect keeps
    // this to once per round, so the alternate isn't re-marked by the same burst.
    //
    // bypassRecastInterval is REQUIRED here, not just bypassRoundCooldown: the
    // primary was sent < 500 ms ago (same server burst as the no-effect reply), so
    // without it CastCoordinator's MinRecastInterval defers the alternate SPELL to the
    // next combat tick and the round is lost anyway — the alt still lagged ~one round
    // (report paradigm-20260827-081223). The primary is already server-confirmed (the
    // no-effect line proves it) and spent no round, so the alternate is entitled to
    // this round's cast slot — the same reasoning DeferPostDebuffAttack already uses.
