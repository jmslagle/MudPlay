// Per-round combat-spell decision unit. Pure decision + room-scoped cast
// bookkeeping; holds NO wire state. The owning CombatManager calls Choose once
// per attack decision, sends the resulting cast (or its weapon swing for
// WeaponAttack), then calls MarkCast on a successful send so the per-room
// counters stay accurate vs what actually reached the server. ResetForNewRoom
// wipes the bookkeeping when the room clears.
//
// Choose resolves the round's combat action (the 1/round physical swing XOR
// attack spell — a spell IS the round's action, it does not stack with a
// swing). Debuffing is an in-between action (≤1/round), resolved separately by
// ChooseDebuff and cast through the shared in-between window, so it never
// appears in the combat-action decision below.
//
// 1. Backstab opener — fires when a backstab is still pending (DoBackstab on +
//    sneaking + surprise round unspent, folded into ctx.BackstabPending) and the
//    target isn't flagged DontBackstab. The opener is the round's action or
//    nothing — a mid-round BS attempt is a guaranteed fail — so it always fires
//    FIRST when eligible, ahead of the spell-vs-physical choice. When it fires
//    the chooser returns Backstab so the engine's BS path owns the swing and no
//    spell goes out.
// 2. Round action — CombatSettings.ActionOrder picks between spells and the
//    weapon. SpellsFirst runs the attack-spell cascade: MultiAttackSpell while
//    its conditions hold (room count ≥ MinEnemies, mana, cast cap), then
//    NormalAttackSpell, then AlternateAttackSpell, then the weapon; a spell that
//    can't fire this round falls through to the swing. PhysicalFirst swings the
//    weapon and reaches for that same cascade only when the weapon path is proven
//    ineffective against this target (ctx.WeaponIneffective — the normal weapon
//    can't damage it and there's no working alternate), so a spell-less build
//    still just swings.
//
// Mana gating reads SpellManaThresholdMode: Percentage treats MinManaPerCast as
// a 0–100 share of max MA; Absolute treats it as raw points. A debuff that can't
// meet its mana gate this round is skipped (we fall through to the attack phase)
// rather than stalling the round.
//
// Three deterministic "skip this single-target attack spell" inputs flow in via
// CombatSpellContext, each gating NormalAttackSpell / AlternateAttackSpell down
// the cascade to the next slot (then the weapon):
//   - ImmuneAttackSpells — the target's species produced a "Your spell has no
//     effect on X." line this room (a hard targeting/immunity mismatch).
//   - LevelBlockedActions — the spell's ReqLevel is below the monster's SpellImmu
//     (a level gate from game data).
//   - ResistBlockedActions — the target resists the spell's damage *element*
//     ≥ 100%, so it would deal 0 damage or heal the monster (elemental only —
//     Magic Resist and poison are not deterministic; see MonsterResistIndex).
