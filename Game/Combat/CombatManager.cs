// Auto-attack engine. Subscribes to RoomEntityClassifier.EntitiesObserved and
// (for re-fire pacing) to KnownPatterns.PartyAttackAnnounce. Picks a target per
// MonsterOverlay.Priority + CombatSettings.TargetOrder, filters out anything not
// flagged MonsterRelationship.Enemy, and sends the configured attack command.
// Server auto-repeats swings each 5-second round; CombatManager re-picks when
// the room re-displays without the current target, and resumes (re-engages)
// when the server reports *Combat Off* mid-fight — e.g. a manual buff / heal
// cast interrupts our round but the mob is still alive and swinging at us.
//
// Target selection — single source of truth across the engine:
//   1. Classifier filters Also-Here to EntityKind.Monster.
//   2. Each monster's MonsterOverlay is resolved via MonsterOverlaySeedStore
//      (Defaults tier) merged with SettingsResolver.ResolveGameData (Global /
//      BBS / Char overrides).
//   3. Engageable = MonsterRelationship.Enemy (Relationship-based only).
//   4. Engageable list is sorted by MonsterAttackPriority (First=0 highest,
//      Last=4 lowest), tiebreak by appearance order in the Also-Here line.
//   5. CombatSettings.TargetOrder picks Normal = first sorted (highest prio) or
//      Reverse = last sorted (lowest prio).
//
// A "moves to attack X" announce drives two independent knobs (the "who" and
// the "when" of party combat):
//
// Target Priority — WHO (CombatSettings.TargetPriority):
//   - Default      — pick our own target; ignore others' announces.
//   - FollowLeader — switch our target to the party leader's announced monster
//                    (PartyState.LeaderName).
//   - FollowMember — switch to the named TargetPriorityMemberName's monster.
// Either follow mode applies the standard un-actionable failback: if game data
// proves we can't hit the followed monster (no weapon hits, every attack spell
// level-blocked) we re-pick our own next actionable target instead of following
// into a fight we can't contribute to.
//
// Attack Order — WHEN (CombatSettings.AttackTiming): re-fires our OWN current
// target to control initiative order; never switches the monster.
//   - Default         — never re-fire.
//   - AttackLastParty — re-fire on a party member's announce (excludes
//                       non-party players).
//   - AttackLastRoom  — re-fire on anyone's announce.
//   - AttackAfter     — re-fire only on the named AttackAfterPlayerName's
//                       announce.
//
// Our own announce never drives either knob (we already swung; matched against
// the own-name reader). Attack Order re-fire requires a non-null CurrentTarget —
// we can only re-issue against a target we already chose. The interim-pick rule:
// on room entry we dispatch our own target immediately (OnEntitiesObserved),
// then a follow mode switches to the leader / member's target the moment they
// announce.
