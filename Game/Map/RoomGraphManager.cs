// for the navigation stack (room tracker, BFS mapper, walker, loop manager,
// auto-lair scheduler).
//
// Seeding: the graph reads Rooms.json through GameDataCache.GetRawTable once per
// active-set switch. Every row turns into a typed Room indexed by RoomKey.
// RoomExit values are produced inline from the per-direction MDB cells
// ("1/3" / "1/3 (Door)" / "0"). The raw JsonDocument is evicted from
// GameDataCache immediately after conversion (per the project's memory-hygiene
// pattern set by MonsterOverlaySeedStore).
//
// Uniqueness index: a side table keyed on (Name, ExitMask) gives the room
// tracker its "is this a 1-of-1 room?" answer in O(1). When the user lands in a
// room whose tuple resolves to exactly one candidate, the tracker promotes to
// Located without further reconciliation. Buckets with > 1 candidate are
// surfaced via FindCandidates for the Tier-2 footprint matcher.
//
// Wiring: AppServices subscribes OnActiveSetChanged to
// GameDataCache.ActiveSetChanged at construction time — every set swap rebuilds
// the graph from scratch. Subscribers to GraphReloaded drop any per-set room
