// Turns the passive SysRoomStatusParser into a request/response: send a sysop
// status and await the room block. Callers (location recovery, Roomba recon)
// want to ask, not to overhear. Same split as AbilBreakdownParser (parses) and
// ManaRegenReroller (sends `abil 145` and consumes the result).
//
// Capability is two-layered, because sysop access can't be detected reliably:
//
//   1. BbsCredentials.HasSysopPowers — the character's existing per-BBS
//      "I have sysop / goto powers" flag. Default off; while it is, nothing is
//      ever sent.
//   2. Auto-disable — a probe that produces no parseable block within the
//      timeout switches the capability off for the rest of the session. This is
//      deliberately NOT a match on a denial message: the wording a denied sysop
//      command produces is unconfirmed, and a timeout is the right answer
//      whatever the server said. Every caller treats a null result as normal and
//      falls back to what it did before.
//
// Only the no-argument form is implemented. `sysop status room <n>` would let us
// read any room without travelling (boss presence, for one), but the game's help
// describes its argument as a bare room number while rooms are map/room pairs
// here, and that wire format is unconfirmed — so it waits for its own design
// rather than being guessed at.
