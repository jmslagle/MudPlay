// Roomba Mode: an automated gang-house (GH) item sorter. Builds an in-memory
// Loop out of the user's labeled GH rooms and hands it to LoopRunner — the
// same circuit engine every saved loop runs on — instead of rolling a
// bespoke navigation state machine the way Auto-Lair did (the anti-pattern
// this feature was explicitly designed not to repeat). GhSweepManager never
// calls AutoWalkManager or emits movement itself: LoopRunner owns the initial
// recon circuit and every shortest-work shuttle used during sorting.
//
// The two phases share the same LoopRunner, but Sorting can replace its route:
//   - Reconning (one lap): pure observation. On
//     arrival at every room in the expanded circuit this manager holds GhSortGate and
//     sends `sea` directly SearchesPerRoom times (settling between each),
//     the same way Sorting sends get/drop directly rather than delegating to
//     another engine — the loop can't step out mid-search. Recorded via
//     GroundItemTracker's room-aligned surveys, merging the visible floor list
//     with repeated hidden-item search results.
//   - Sorting: visible items dispatch immediately; only an item recon marked
//     hidden repeats the configured searches before pickup. After each verified
//     transaction the active Loop is replaced by a two-way shortest-work shuttle:
//     nearest carried destination first, otherwise nearest remaining source.
//     GhSortGate stays held until the replacement route is ready.
//
// The sort queue is built ONLY from items this manager itself observed on a
// GH room floor during its own recon laps (_observedByRoom, sourced solely
// from GroundItemTracker) — never from InventoryManager's carried snapshot.
// That's a hard invariant, not an incidental side effect: a sweep must never
// treat something the player was already carrying before it started as
// sortable.
//
// Every _observedByRoom merge (recon and the post-sort final-recon pass alike)
// also feeds GhItemLocationStore, a BBS-tier "last seen here" log independent
// of this manager's own per-sweep state — see RoombaQueryHandler for the
// @roomba remote command it backs.
