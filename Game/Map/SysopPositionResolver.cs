// the recovery gate is about to start reversing moves to work out where we are
// — or the tracker has given up and gone Lost — one `sys st` prints the room's
// true map/room number, and SetLocated turns that straight into a confirmed
// position. That replaces the whole backtrack escalation and the "I am here"
// map click at the end of it.
//
// Same shape as ParadigmPositionResolver (ask → authoritative key → SetLocated
// → re-anchor the gate), with two differences: the answer arrives through
// SysStatusProbe's own request/response rather than a router pattern, and the
// capability is a per-BBS user flag rather than a realm.
//
// Every decline returns false or raises LocateFailed, so the caller falls
// through to exactly what it did before — capability off or auto-disabled,
// throttled, suppressed, the probe came back empty, or the room named isn't in
// the active graph. A confident wrong answer is worse than no answer.
