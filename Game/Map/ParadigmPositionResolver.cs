// Paradigm-only authoritative position re-sync. On a ParaMud realm the game
// answers `rm` with a "Location: <map>,<room>" line reporting the player's own
// true position (see GAME_MECHANICS.md). When the recovery gate suspects the
// heuristic tracker has drifted, it asks this resolver to fire `rm`; the reply
// hard-locates the tracker and re-anchors the gate, so navigation never falls
// through to the footprint backtrack / "Lost" dialog on Paradigm. Stock realms
// have no `rm`, so TryRequestResync no-ops (returns false) and the gate keeps
// its existing heuristic ladder.
//
// One request at a time: while an `rm` is in flight we ignore new requests and
// arm a short timeout. The reply (or the timeout) clears the in-flight state.
// A brief throttle after each request stops a rapid-fire mismatch storm from
// spamming `rm` at the wire. The engine is paused for the round-trip by the
// gate, so the reported room reflects a stationary position — no stale answer.
